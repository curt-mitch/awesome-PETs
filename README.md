## Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

**Note**: Federated learning by itself does not guarantee data privacy, but when used in combination with other PETs it can become privacy-preserving.

There are several different Awesome lists for federated learning, but this one seems to be the most popular. Note that it's federated learning generally, not just PPFL: [https://github.com/innovation-cat/Awesome-Federated-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/innovation-cat/Awesome-Federated-Machine-Learning)

### Papers
